AB  - The V3D system provides three-dimensional (3D) visualization of gigabyte-sized
      microscopy image stacks in real time on current laptops and desktops. V3D
      streamlines the online analysis, measurement and proofreading of complicated
      image patterns by combining ergonomic functions for selecting a location in an
      image directly in 3D space and for displaying biological measurements, such as
      from fluorescent probes, using the overlaid surface objects. V3D runs on all
      major computer platforms and can be enhanced by software plug-ins to address
      specific biological problems. To demonstrate this extensibility, we built a
      V3D-based application, V3D-Neuron, to reconstruct complex 3D neuronal structures 
      from high-resolution brain images. V3D-Neuron can precisely digitize the
      morphology of a single neuron in a fruitfly brain in minutes, with about a
      17-fold improvement in reliability and tenfold savings in time compared with
      other neuron reconstruction tools. Using V3D-Neuron, we demonstrate the
      feasibility of building a 3D digital atlas of neurite tracts in the fruitfly
      brain.
